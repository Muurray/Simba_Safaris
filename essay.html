INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic acted as an unprecedented external shock that accelerated digital disruption across multiple industries, particularly within the food and beverage (F&B) sector, which began spreading globally in 2019, had a devastating impact on the world economythe. Countries were forced to impose border closures, quarantine measures, and social restrictions, which led many businesses to either shut down temporarily or close completely (Souza et al., 2022). Industries like global trade, tourism, and food services were hit especially hard, resulting in widespread job losses and financial instability. Rather than functioning solely as a temporary crisis, the pandemic exposed structural vulnerabilities within food service business models and intensified the need for digitally enabled solutions.During this period, people also became far more cautious about physical interactions, particularly in public spaces like restaurants.
In response, academic literature highlights a rapid shift towards contactless digital technologies, including mobile ordering systems, QR-code menus, and digital payment platforms, which were positioned as both risk-mitigation mechanisms and sources of competitive advantage (Tsai, Lin and Chen, 2024). These technologies reduced physical interaction between staff and customers while simultaneously enhancing operational efficiency and service speed.To adapt to these challenges, the food and beverage (F&B) industry began turning towards contactless services as a sustainable solution. These technologies helped reduce direct contact between restaurant staff and customers, minimising the risk of virus transmission and improving food safety. Beyond health protection, contactless systems also brought greater convenience allowing customers to order, pay, and collect their food seamlessly through mobile devices. This not only helped rebuild consumer confidence during uncertain times but also made restaurant operations more efficient and resilient against future disruptions (Tsai, Lin and Chen, 2024). However, scholars remain divided on whether such digital adaptations represent short-term crisis responses or longer-term transformations of restaurant business models. While some studies argue that contactless technologies strengthen organisational resilience and customer trust, others question their sustainability, particularly for smaller independent restaurants facing cost and capability constraints (Bonfanti et al., 2023).
The COVID-19 pandemic changed the way we live, work, and even eat. With strict stay at home orders, social life was completely disrupted, and the way we got our food had to adjust quickly. For many people, eating out is a regular part of life, but during the pandemic, restaurants and food services faced huge challenges. This period highlighted how vital the food service industry is not just for the economythe, but for everyday routines and lifestyles.
As the world learned more about the virus, new safety protocols and hygiene measures were introduced, especially in restaurants. Moving forward, the industry will likely continue to evolve and match new habits and expectations. Studying these changes helps us understand how the pandemic reshaped food services and offers insights into how restaurants and consumers can adapt in a post pandemic world (Souza et al., 2022). This literature review critically evaluates emerging digital business trends causing disruption within the food and beverage industry. Using digital business model innovation and technology-enabled service transformation as analytical lenses, the review synthesises contemporary academic debates to identify areas of convergence, tension, and research gaps related to post-pandemic digital disruption.


 MAIN BODY
Remodeling food services – post pandemic perspectives 
Even before COVID-19, restaurants followed hygiene rules, but the pandemic made us rethink safety in a more hands-on way. COVID-19, however, intensified academic and managerial attention towards visible and technology-supported safety measures, including contactless ordering, automated service processes, and digitally monitored hygiene practices.Hand-washing stations moved to entrances, menus became easy-to-clean, tables were spaced out, and some buffets switched to set meals. Acrylic barriers and regular air filter maintenance added extra peace of mind. Although measures such as temperature screening were widely adopted, the literature questions their effectiveness when implemented in isolation. Scholars increasingly emphasise a layered safety approach in which digital tools complement, rather than replace, human oversight and organisational culture (Souza et al., 2022).Temperature checks helped, but we learned they aren’t foolproof safety which is really about layering small, practical measures to keep everyone comfortable (Souza et al., 2022).
How Online Delivery Shapes Restaurant Success Today
Contemporary research suggests that restaurant performance within digital ecosystems extends beyond financial metrics to include platform visibility, customer engagement, and technological integration. Yan, Idris and Ali (2024) argue that digital delivery platforms significantly influence competitive positioning by reshaping how value is created and captured across the service journey.When I looked at how restaurant performance is measured, I realised it’s really about the bigger picture  not just profits, but how smoothly the business runs, how customers respond, and whether the restaurant can stay competitive. The article also helped me see how features like discounts, app design, and paid promotions impact each restaurant differently based on things like its size or pricing style (Yan, Idris and Ali, 2024).
From a consumer perspective, increased digital literacy and platform dependency have heightened switching behaviour, intensifying competitive pressure among restaurants. However, Bonfanti et al. (2023) caution that excessive reliance on third-party platforms may erode brand autonothe and long-term profitability, highlighting a key tension within the literature. At the same time, customers today have become more digital, picky, and quick to switch, especially after the pandemic pushed everyone online. That’s why user-friendly apps and reliable delivery systems matter so much now they shape how safe, satisfied, and loyal people feel when ordering food (Bonfanti et al., 2023).
Food, Restaurants, and Contactless Payments
Digital and contactless payments have completely changed how we grab our meals. Using mobile wallets or tap to pay systems feels faster, cleaner, and way safer especially after COVID-19. Digital and contactless payment systems are widely regarded as catalysts for service transformation within the F&B sector. Studies indicate that mobile wallets and tap-to-pay technologies enhance perceived convenience and hygiene while reducing transaction friction (Liu, Wang and Zhao, 2022). Nevertheless, critics argue that such systems may exacerbate digital exclusion among less technologically adept consumers, raising concerns regarding accessibility and equity.We love how easy it is, and restaurants benefit too, with smoother service and happier customers. Apps like Uber Eats and Deliveroo make checkout effortless with Apple Pay or Google Pay, while also letting restaurants reward us and personalise offers, making every dining experience feel convenient and thoughtful (Liu, Wang and Zhao, 2022).


Self-Ordering Systems in Casual Dining Restaurants
Self-ordering systems like digital kiosks and tablet menus have changed how people order food in restaurants. Instead of relying on staff, customers can browse, customize, and pay on their own, making the process faster and more convenient. These systems also help restaurants reduce staff workload and mistakes while collecting useful customer data.
However, not everyone prefers this shift some still value personal service and human interaction. After the pandemic, many restaurants now use a mix of both, keeping digital systems for efficiency but still offering friendly service for connection. Overall, self-ordering technology has made dining smoother and more customer-focused (Chong, 2022).
Consumer Perceptions and Adoption of Cloud Kitchens
Cloud kitchens restaurants that exist only for delivery have really changed how we eat, especially after COVID-19. People choose them based on price, variety, and how exciting or innovative the food feels, while safety concerns can affect trust. Emotional satisfaction also plays a role, and interestingly, gender and marital status shape these perceptions differently. For us as diners, trust is everything, and for cloud kitchens, understanding this helps them create better more personalized experiences (Pookulangara, Wen & Josiam, 2023).
Customer Engagement in Meal Ordering Apps
Engaging with meal ordering apps (MOAs) is about more than just ordering food it’s how people think, feel, and act while using the app. Research shows that things like online reviews, food quality, restaurant reputation, service, delivery, and app usability all shape this engagement. When users have positive experiences, they’re more likely to keep using the app and stay loyal. The COVID-19 pandemic made MOAs even more important, especially in countries like China and Indonesia, where contactless ordering became essential. While Chinese users valued convenience and online reviews, Indonesian users cared more about brand image and price. In short, a good MOA experience isn’t just about food it’s about creating a smooth, enjoyable journey that keeps customers coming back (Shah, Qayyum & Lee, 2023).

What Makes People Share Food App Experiences 
This study looked at Indian users of food ordering apps to see what drives them to share positive experiences. The survey of 375 respondents showed that perceived value, trust, and loyalty are the key factors, while age, gender, family size, and satisfaction played little role. For app developers and restaurants, the takeaway is clear focus on building trust, delivering value, and encouraging loyalty to boost word of mouth and grow your customer base (Sampat & Sabat, 2020).
How Emotions Drive Food Delivery App Use
This study looks at how the look and feel of food delivery apps their design, ease of use, and overall vibe affect the way people feel when using them, from excitement to satisfaction to a sense of control. These emotions then shape whether users keep coming back and, in some cases, develop compulsive habits around ordering. The research shows just how our emotional connection to an app can influence our choices, especially in a world where convenience and digital experiences have become part of everyday life after COVID-19 (Rejón-Guardia, 2024).
Adapting Franchises to a Contactless World
The pandemic has changed the way we live, work, and shop, and franchises are no exception. With people wary of in-person interactions, mobile ordering and contactless payments have become the new normal. Smaller franchisees are even creating their own apps to stay afloat and avoid hefty third-party fees. While these technologies make life easier for customers, they also bring data security challenges. To navigate this new reality, franchises are updating agreements to include cybersecurity insurance, infrastructure requirements, and invention clauses, ensuring both safety and innovation in a rapidly shifting world (Brunkhorst, 2020).
Managing Online Food Orders and Platform Fairness
This research helps me understand how online food delivery works behind the scenes. It shows how platforms, restaurants, riders, and customers interact, and how policies like rider wages or restaurant commission caps affect fairness and competition (Ji, Li and Wang, 2024). At the same time, it highlights how apps protect customer data with blockchain encryption, so only the restaurant and the customer can access sensitive info (Alves, 2021).

Reducing Food Waste in the German Food Service Sector
The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way food service businesses operate, and one surprising outcome was its effect on food waste. Many restaurants and cafes in Germany reported that waste either stayed the same or even decreased, thanks to more careful planning, simpler menus, and cooking on demand. Digital tools have played a big role too helping with forecasting, analyzing waste, sharing surplus food, and training staff. These technologies not only make operations more efficient but also raise awareness about sustainability, showing that even in tough times, we can make smarter choices and waste less (Strotmann et al., 2022).
How Healthy Are Kids’ Menus on Delivery Apps
The study looked at kids’ menus from 57 restaurants on Uber Eats in Santiago, Chile, using the KIMEHS tool to measure how healthy they are. Most menus scored poorly, offering fried or processed meats, fries, sugary drinks, and very few vegetables, fruits, or water. Only a tiny fraction included toys or allergen info. Prices didn’t vary much by neighborhood. Overall, the findings highlight how unhealthy children’s menus are and the need for better options and clearer nutrition info (Zapata-Quiroga et al., 2025).
Factors Influencing Online Food Choices
This study looks at what makes young people continue using online food delivery services (OFDS), especially during COVID-19. It found that customers are more likely to keep using these services if they perceive the food as healthy, the platform as hygienic, the app easy to use, and have a positive attitude toward it. Fear of COVID-19 and perceived risks of eating out also play a smaller role. Gender matters too men respond more to hygiene and health measures, while women care more about attitude and loyalty rewards. For restaurants, highlighting health, hygiene, app convenience, and targeted marketing can boost customer loyalty (Francioni et al., 2022). Also, placing lower-calorie options at the top of menus can nudge people to pick healthier meals (Bianchi et al., 2023).

Understanding Robot Baristas: A Personal Take 
This study really shows how people are adapting to robot baristas in coffee shops. It turns out that what matters most to customers is not just usefulness, but also how enjoyable the experience feels. Interestingly, people still miss human interaction, and that can affect how they feel about using robots. While risk doesn’t seem to worry them much, innovativeness makes them more likely to accept it. Essentially, a mix of smart AI for simple tasks and human baristas for detailed service seems key to keeping coffee experiences both safe and enjoyable in today’s world (Sung and Jeon, 2020).
How Restaurants Navigate Third-Party Delivery Apps
The rise of third-party online food delivery (TPOFD) apps has changed how restaurants operate and how people order food. This study explored why restaurants use these services, what works, what doesn’t, and how they adapt. Key insights include motivations, challenges, benefits, and plans for the future (Traynor et al., 2022).
Exploring Online Menu Labelling in Canada
This study looked at how calorie information is displayed on popular Canadian food delivery apps like Uber Eats, DoorDash, and SkipTheDishes. Researchers analyzed menus from 13 major restaurant brands across three provinces, noting variations in labelling practices and how nutritional info was presented to customer (Vanderlee et al., 2023).
Evaluating Online Food Delivery Platforms
Research shows that online food delivery (OFD) is influenced by many factors, like convenience, price, service quality, and sustainability. Experts often use tools like Fuzzy AHP to handle uncertain opinions and WASPAS to rank options based on multiple criteria. Combining these methods helps evaluate OFD platforms more accurately, ensuring that decisions are fair, practical, and robust. This approach also captures the complexity of the market while providing a clear way to compare and choose the best sustainable options (Nguyen, Lin and Dang, 2021).




Applying Chaffey’s (2019) Growth Model: Making Dine-in smarter and easier 
Growth Stage	What It Means (In MyThe Words)	How It Connects to the Restaurant Tech Article
Reach	Reaching more customers by being present where they are.	Restaurants need to show up digitally strong websites, apps, and online ordering because younger customers search and order digitally (Solocheck, 2020).
Act	Encouraging customers to interact or take small steps toward a purchase.	Features like kiosks, geofencing, Wi-Fi, and easy menus help customers explore options comfortably (Solocheck, 2020).
Convert	Turning interest into an actual purchase.	Fast, accurate, contactless ordering and payments convince customers to complete the order without hesitation (Solocheck, 2020).
Engage	Keeping customers loyal and coming back.	Delivery tracking, personalised offers, smooth order experiences, and consistent technology all help build long term loyalty (Solocheck, 2020).

Ghost Kitchens and Porter’s Five Forces (1980): A Human Perspective Porter’s Five Forces and Digital Disruption in the Food and Beverage Industry
Porter’s Five Forces framework (Porter, 1980) provides a structured approach for analysing how digital transformation has reshaped competitive pressures within the food and beverage industry. While originally designed for traditional industries, scholars argue that the model remains relevant when adapted to digitally mediated markets, particularly those characterised by platformisation and technology-enabled business models (Bharadwaj et al., 2013).
Force	What It Means	How I See It Personally in Our Perspective in Ghost Production
Threat of New Entrants	New competitors entering the market.	Digital technologies have significantly reduced barriers to entry in the food service sector, particularly through the emergence of cloud and ghost kitchens. These models require lower capital investment by eliminating the need for physical dining spaces, enabling rapid market entry for digitally enabled operators (Ashton, Tuomi and Backman, 2023). However, the literature also highlights that dependency on digital platforms and delivery aggregators may introduce new barriers, such as high commission fees and limited control over customer relationships, which can constrain long-term competitiveness.With ghost kitchens, starting a delivery-only operation is easier and cheaper than opening a full restaurant. I feel like anyone with the right location and tech can join, so the market is constantly evolving (Ashton, Tuomi and Backman, 2023).
Bargaining Power of Suppliers	Influence of suppliers on price or quality.	Supplier power within digitally transformed food services has become increasingly complex. Traditional suppliers of ingredients and packaging retain influence over cost and quality, while digital platform providers now function as powerful intermediaries controlling access to customers and data (Tsai, Lin and Chen, 2024). Several studies argue that this shift has increased supplier power asymmetry, particularly disadvantaging smaller operators who lack negotiating leverage.In ghost production, suppliers of ingredients or packaging have some power. I think restaurants need to balance cost and quality carefully because deliveries depend on consistent supplies (Ashton, Tuomi and Backman, 2023).
Bargaining Power of Customers	Customers influence on prices, service, and quality.	Digital ordering platforms have enhanced consumer power by increasing price transparency, choice, and switching ease. Customers can compare restaurants instantly based on price, ratings, delivery speed, and promotions, intensifying pressure on restaurants to compete on multiple dimensions simultaneously (Bonfanti et al., 2023). While increased buyer power can drive service innovation and quality improvement, it may also encourage price sensitivity and reduced brand loyalty, raising concerns about long-term profitability.Ghost delivery apps put customers in control. I see this as diners demanding fast, hot meals and easy ordering; restaurants must adapt quickly to keep them happy (Ashton, Tuomi and Backman, 2023).
Threat of Substitutes	Alternative products or services fulfilling the same need.	The literature identifies a growing range of substitutes enabled by digitalisation, including meal kits, ready-to-eat grocery offerings, and home cooking supported by digital content and delivery services (Souza et al., 2022). Although experiential dining remains difficult to substitute fully, the convenience and perceived safety of these alternatives have altered consumption habits, particularly in post-pandemic contexts.There are so many options: other ghost kitchens, meal kits, or ready to eat stores. For me, it means you must stand out with taste, price, or speed (Ashton, Tuomi and Backman, 2023).
Industry Rivalry	Competition among existing players.	Competitive rivalry within the food and beverage industry has intensified as digital technologies enable rapid imitation of service innovations such as mobile ordering, contactless payments, and delivery integration. Scholars argue that this technological convergence reduces differentiation and accelerates commoditisation, forcing firms into continuous innovation cycles to remain visible and relevant within platform-based ecosystems (Bharadwaj et al., 2013; Traynor et al., 2022).Ghost kitchens compete fiercely for online visibility, delivery slots, and menu uniqueness. Personally, I see this as a constant pressure to innovate and maintain efficiency (Ashton, Tuomi and Backman, 2023).
CONCLUSION
The analysis has examined the impact of digital transformation on competitive dynamics within the food and beverage industry through the application of established strategic frameworks. By integrating Porter’s Five Forces with Chaffey’s Digital Growth Model, the study demonstrates that digitalisation has fundamentally reshaped industry structure, intensified competitive rivalry, and redistributed power across the value chain. The literature indicates that while digital technologies reduce barriers to entry and enhance operational efficiency, they simultaneously introduce new strategic dependencies, particularly through reliance on digital platforms and intermediaries. Increased buyer power, heightened rivalry, and the proliferation of substitutes highlight the paradox of digital transformation: opportunities for growth coexist with increased strategic vulnerability.
Reflecting on the changes that the COVID-19 pandemic brought to the food and beverage industry, it’s clear that the sector has undergone a profound transformation, reshaping not only how restaurants operate but also how we, as consumers, engage with food. Personally, observing this shift has been eye-opening because it highlighted how resilient and adaptable the industry can be when faced with unprecedented challenges. Restaurants had to rethink the fundamentals of service, hygiene, and customer interaction almost overnight, and this period emphasized the value of innovation and technology in creating safer, more efficient dining experiences.
the findings suggest that traditional strategic models remain valuable when applied reflexively and adapted to digitally mediated contexts. Rather than rendering classical frameworks obsolete, digital disruption necessitates their reinterpretation to account for platform dominance, data asymmetry, and accelerated innovation cycles.
What struck me most is how contactless services, self-ordering systems, and digital payment methods became more than just convenient tools they became essential lifelines that allowed the industry to continue functioning under extreme constraints. Experiencing these changes as a diner, I noticed that the reassurance of hygiene, coupled with the simplicity of digital ordering, made a real difference in mythe comfort and willingness to engage with restaurants. It became evident that efficiency and convenience no longer compete with hospitality they complement it, allowing both customers and staff to feel safer and more valued. Future research may benefit from longitudinal studies examining how firms sustain competitive advantage within platform ecosystems and how strategic autonothe can be preserved amid increasing digital intermediation
At the same time, the rise of online food delivery and cloud kitchens has changed mythe perspective on what “restaurant experiences” mean. I now see that dining is not confined to a physical location; it can happen anywhere, powered by apps and logistics that prioritize speed, quality, and personalization. This shift has made me more aware of the emotional and psychological aspects of food consumption, from trust and loyalty to the excitement of discovering new options from the comfort of home. As a consumer, I now pay attention to the design, usability, and engagement features of meal ordering apps, realizing how much they shape mythe decisions and overall satisfaction.
Looking ahead, I feel that the pandemic has permanently accelerated the adoption of technology and sustainability in food services. Restaurants are now balancing efficiency, safety, and human connection in a delicate mix, while also exploring opportunities to reduce waste, offer healthier options, and create engaging, personalized experiences. As someone who enjoys dining out, ordering in, and experimenting with new food experiences, I appreciate how these innovations have not only made life easier but also made me feel more confident and cared for as a customer.
Ultimately, this period has been a reminder that the food industry is more than an economic engine it is a vital part of daily life, social connection, and well-being. By embracing technology thoughtfully, maintaining trust, and keeping the customer experience at the heart of operations, restaurants can emerge from this crisis stronger, smarter, and more adaptable. For me, witnessing and participating in these changes has reinforced the idea that progress and human connection can go hand in hand, creating a future where dining is safer, more enjoyable, and accessible to all.
